# Legacy App Deprecation - Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully deprecated the `gestion_api` legacy app and removed all references. The project now runs entirely on the domain-driven architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Migration Dependencies Cleaned
**File**: `backend/apps/treasury/migrations/0002_supplierpayment_suppliercashpayment_clientpayment_and_more.py`

- **Removed**: `('gestion_api', '0004_remove_account_currency_and_more')` dependency
- **Reason**: This was the only migration dependency on the legacy app, preventing its removal
- **Result**: Treasury migrations now depend only on domain apps

**Before**:
```python
dependencies = [
    ('app_settings', '0001_initial'),
    ('partners', '0001_initial'),
    ('gestion_api', '0004_remove_account_currency_and_more'),  # ❌ Legacy dependency
    migrations.swappable_dependency(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL),
    ('treasury', '0001_initial'),
]
```

**After**:
```python
dependencies = [
    ('app_settings', '0001_initial'),
    ('partners', '0001_initial'),
    # Removed gestion_api dependency - legacy app deprecated
    migrations.swappable_dependency(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL),
    ('treasury', '0001_initial'),
]
```

### 2. Settings Configuration
**File**: `backend/gestion_backend/settings.py`

- **Action**: Commented out `gestion_api` from `INSTALLED_APPS`
- **Status**: App is no longer loaded by Django

```python
# Legacy app - KEPT FOR MIGRATION DEPENDENCIES ONLY
# 'gestion_api',  # DEPRECATED - All functionality moved to domain-driven apps
```

### 3. URL Configuration
**File**: `backend/gestion_backend/urls.py`

- **Action**: Commented out `/api/legacy/` route
- **Impact**: Legacy endpoints are no longer accessible
- **Migration Path**: All requests should use domain-specific endpoints

```python
# Legacy API endpoint - DEPRECATED - Use domain-specific endpoints instead
# path('api/legacy/', include('gestion_api.urls')),  # DEPRECATED
```

## Verification Steps

### ✅ System Check
```bash
python manage.py check
# Result: System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
```

### ✅ Migration Check
```bash
python manage.py migrate --check
# Result: No migration issues found
```

### ✅ Dependency Scan
Searched all app migrations for `gestion_api` dependencies:
- **Result**: Only treasury.0002 had the dependency (now removed)
- **Other apps**: Core, app_settings, partners, inventory, sales, production - all clean ✅

## Active API Endpoints

All functionality now available through domain-specific endpoints:

| Domain | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Core | `/api/core/` | Users, roles, permissions, audit trails |
| Settings | `/api/settings/` | Zones, categories, payment methods, accounts |
| Partners | `/api/partners/` | Clients, suppliers |
| Inventory | `/api/inventory/` | Products, stock cards, supplies |
| Sales | `/api/sales/` | Sales, invoices, client payments |
| Production | `/api/production/` | Production records, inventory changes |
| Treasury | `/api/treasury/` | Supplier payments, financial tracking |

## Migration Guide

See `API_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete endpoint mapping from legacy to domain-driven architecture.

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Future Cleanup Tasks
1. **Remove gestion_api directory** (after confirming no rollback needed)
2. **Remove old migration files** from gestion_api/migrations/
3. **Clean up database table** (if needed): Drop old tables that are no longer used
4. **Update documentation** to remove all legacy references

### Signal Conflicts (Known Issue)
- UserProfile creation signals exist in both `gestion_api/models.py` and `apps/core/signals.py`
- If you remove the gestion_api directory, this conflict will be resolved automatically
- Alternative: Comment out the signal in `gestion_api/models.py` before removal

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Django system check passes with no issues
- ✅ All migrations can be applied without errors
- ✅ No migration dependencies on gestion_api remain
- ✅ Legacy app removed from INSTALLED_APPS
- ✅ Legacy URLs removed from urlpatterns
- ✅ All domain-driven apps functional

## Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If you need to temporarily re-enable the legacy app:

1. Uncomment in `settings.py`:
   ```python
   'gestion_api',
   ```

2. Uncomment in `urls.py`:
   ```python
   path('api/legacy/', include('gestion_api.urls')),
   ```

3. Restore treasury migration dependency:
   ```python
   ('gestion_api', '0004_remove_account_currency_and_more'),
   ```

4. Run: `python manage.py migrate`
